# SymmetricalBroccoli

This is a work in progress.

This is a plug-in to X-Plane 11 that receives packets over UDP from a
mobile phone app or other source in the simple format that is used by
many other head tracking applications.

Each packet is 56 bytes and consists of six doubles (8-byte floating
point numbers): The user head's x, y, z position (in centimetres)
relative to the phone, and yaw, pitch, and roll angle (in degrees).

One source for such packets is the iOS app [Head
Tracker](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/head-tracker/id1527710071).
That is what I use. It is simple and works.

Future plans
------------

* The filtering of the input needs work.
* It would be nice to make it work for MSFS, too, or maybe MSFS
  already by itself can accept such UDP packets?

General musings
---------------

I wonder why X-Plane itself doesn't have the option to listen to this
kind of UDP packets? As seen from the source code here, it is quite
trivial. (More than half of the source code here is not directly
related to the actual task but is for logging, or portability to the
three platforms.)

Why didn't I just use OpenTrack instead? I love to code, and it was
more fun to start from scratch to make something minimal but
sufficient. After one evening I had something that basically worked. I
had a look at the OpenTrack [source
code](https://github.com/opentrack/opentrack.git)x and it seemd quite
over-engineered for my simple needs.
